# Neural Network From scratch using python 🌐

This repository contains a Python implementation of a simple neural network using the `nnfs` library. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the fundamentals of neural network operations including layer initialization, activation functions, and loss calculations, along with data visualization using `matplotlib`.

## Project Structure 📂

- `neural_network.py`: The main Python script that sets up and runs the neural network.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.

## Features 🌟

- **Layer Implementation**: Includes a custom dense layer with initialization for weights and biases.
- **Activation Functions**: Implements ReLU and Softmax activation functions.
- **Loss Calculation**: Utilizes Categorical Crossentropy to calculate the loss.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizes spiral data distribution which the network attempts to classify.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
